    "### We use bitwize operation while working with mask:\n",
    "\n",
    "In OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), a mask is a binary image used to specify certain regions of interest or to filter out unwanted parts of an image. A mask image consists of pixels with values of either 0 or 255 (or sometimes 0 or 1), where 0 typically represents the background or areas to be ignored, and 255 represents the foreground or areas to be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Masks are commonly used in image processing tasks such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Region of Interest (ROI) selection**: You can apply a mask to focus on specific parts of an image for further processing while ignoring the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Image Filtering**: By applying a mask, you can perform operations only on certain regions of an image, leaving other areas unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Image Segmentation**: Masks are used to separate objects of interest from the background by assigning different values to pixels inside and outside the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Image Blending**: Masks can be used to blend two images together seamlessly by specifying which parts of each image should contribute to the final result.\n",
